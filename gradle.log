> Task :clean
Caching disabled for task ':clean' because:
  Build cache is disabled
Task ':clean' is not up-to-date because:
  Task has not declared any outputs despite executing actions.

> Task :compileJava FAILED
Caching disabled for task ':compileJava' because:
  Build cache is disabled
Task ':compileJava' is not up-to-date because:
  Task has failed previously.
The input changes require a full rebuild for incremental task ':compileJava'.
Compilation mode: in-process compilation
Full recompilation is required because no incremental change information is available. This is usually caused by clean builds or changing compiler arguments.
